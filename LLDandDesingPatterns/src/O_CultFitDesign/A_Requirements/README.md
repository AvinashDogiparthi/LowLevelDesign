## ðŸš¦ **Introduction**
The **Gym Slot Booking System** is a platform that allows users to book and manage gym slots. The system supports two user roles: **Admin** and **Customer**, with distinct permissions for each. It also provides a **waitlist queue** to ensure users get notified and automatically booked if slots become available.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Problem Statement**
Design a system to manage gym slot bookings with the following requirements:
- Users should be differentiated as **Admins** and **Customers**.
- A **waitlist queue** should be implemented for customers:
    - Customers will be notified and automatically booked if a slot becomes available.
- Real-time display of **slot availability** should be provided.

- **Notification System:** Automatically notifies customers and books slots if they become available.

### âœ… **Data Structures:**
